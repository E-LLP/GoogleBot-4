## Summary
This program, using Google Search as the tunnel of information, attempts to find out as much data about 
any given person. It searches through websites and figures out if the site actually contains information 
on said person.
 
## Scenario 
You are a student about to graduate and about to apply to a bunch of jobs. You had fun but are now 
worried something out there may damage your image. You had already used Googles Image search on yourself but 
now need to worry about all of the text written pages. You don't want to spend weeks doing this, so you need
a program which can search hundreds of pages in mere minutes for you.

## Credits 
I received some help on searching from this stackoverflow question.
